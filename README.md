# Testing-with-Java

"Testing-with-Java" is a implementation of test cases with JUnit.
 This work was inspired by [The art of software testing by Glenford J. Myers](https://www.amazon.com.br/Art-Software-Testing-Glenford-Myers/dp/1118031962)
 
 ## Target
 
 TriangleUtils - A utility class with a single public method responsible for evaluating either a triangle is a isosceles,scalene or equilateral.
 
 ## Approach
 
 Tests will be conduct over common scenarios to expose bugs that don't appear on ideal-scenario-testing. E.g: Three equals sides make a equilateral triangle, but 0,0,0 don't.
